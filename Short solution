For the short solution:

"any" is a built in function that takes a list, casts the elements of the list to bool and returns true if any element of the list is true.
Into any is being passed a list/generator comprehension, what is happening here is this, 'b' is being checked for the value v-i "v-i in b"
which returns a bool, true if the value" v-i" is in the list 'b', the value 'i' is coming from the for loop "for i in a" which is looping
over the elements of list 'a' and pointing 'i' to the next element of the array on each iteration of the loop. What this means is that the 
list passed to any is a list of bools where each element 'i' corresponds to an element in a and tells if "a[i]" has a complement in 'b', 
so if "any" of these elements are true then return true.
